# You chose to enter the western gate in the garden.

You notice that there is a gate on the western side of the garden and decide to enter the gate. After passing through the gate, the scenery changes. Instead of being in the garden anymore, you are standing on a large checkerboard. There are some large white chess standing by your side. They are as tall as your height. It seems like you are one of them. Suddenly, you heard one sound. "Game starts." You look around the surroundings hastily because you don't see anyone here. While looking for the person who just announced the game, one of the black chess moves to you. You scream since no one moves it. It just goes to you by itself.

"It is so weird!" You think. When you think the black chess will stop moving, it moves to you faster and faster. You try to run away from it, but you find you can't move because you are stuck on the checkerboard. At the moment that you think it is going to hit you, you scream and close your eyes. However, after a few seconds, you don't get hit. Since you are confused, you open your eyes and find you are lying on your bed. Then, you realize that it was just a dream, and the worst thing is that you are running late for school!

As a result, you jump out of the bed and start a busy day.
